Character
---------

A character is a unit that engages in actions during tactical combat. It also
exists during the overworld game.

Characters can gain active and passive abilities.

When characters die it is permanent*.

State Based Actions
-------------------

State based actions are triggers that are checked every time the game state changes.

For example: characters dying when they have zero health, a team winning when
there are no more opponents, etc.

Basically inspired by MtG.
