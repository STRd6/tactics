State Based Actions
-------------------

State based actions are triggers that are checked every time the game state changes.

For example: characters dying when they have zero health, a team winning when
there are no more opponents, etc.

Basically inspired by MtG.

Stun
----

Some effects can stun characters. Stunned characters will be unable to perform
reactions and their turn is ended (actions reduced to zero). Stun is reduced by
one level at the start of every turn. If the character has any level of stun
greater than zero then the character will have no actions for that turn.

Many attacks add a stun of 1 which is cleared at the character's
following turn and serves to halt reaction abilities.

Some special attacks will have a stun of 2 or 3. The stunned character will
lose their actions until the stun is removed.

Stun doesn't stack, the maximum of the character's stun level and the effect's
stun amount is used.

Tribe
-----

The player controls a tribe throughout the game. The tribe is composed of characters.

The characters in a tribe can be arranged into squads.

The tribe has a home base.
