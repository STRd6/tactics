It also\nexists during the overworld game.\n\nCharacters can gain active and passive abilities.\n\nWhen characters die it is permanent*.\n\nSquad\n-----\n\nA group of 2-6 characters that represent a single team in the tactical combat.\n\nMission\n-------\n\nA mission is a tactical combat engagement using one squad from the player's tribe.\n\nRaces\n-----\n\n- Humans\n- Elves\n- Dwarves\n- Goblins\n- Serpent Men\n- Undead\n\nState Based Actions\n-------------------\n\nState based actions are triggers that are checked every time the game state changes.\n\nFor example: characters dying when they have zero health, a team winning when\nthere are no more opponents, etc.\n\nBasically inspired by MtG.\n\nStun\n----\n\nSome effects can stun characters. Stunned characters will be unable to perform\nreactions and their turn is ended (actions reduced to zero). Stun is reduced by\none level at the start of every turn. If the character has any level of stun\ngreater than zero then the character will have no actions for that turn.\n\nMany attacks add a stun of 1 which is cleared at the character's\nfollowing turn and serves to halt reaction abilities.\n\nSome special attacks will have a stun of 2 or 3. The stunned character will\nlose their actions until the stun is removed.\n\nStun doesn't stack, the maximum of the character's stun level and the effect's\nstun amount is used.\n\nTribe\n-----\n\nThe player controls a tribe throughout the game. The tribe is composed of characters.\n\nThe characters in a tribe can be arranged into squads.\n\nThe tribe has a home base.\n",
